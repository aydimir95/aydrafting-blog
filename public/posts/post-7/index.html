2. What is a Class?

In C#, classes are templates related to the creation and management of objects. There are many predefined classes available in C# and the Revit API.
We use them for a wide range of things and will regularly be creating and developing our own classes.


Accessing properties / methods of a Class

Property:

object.Property -> to access a property


Method:

Object.Method(argument1, argument2, etc) -> to access a method



Namespaces

When we create classes, we first tell them where they belong in our project.
Namespaces can be nested within others using a dot separator, eventually tied back to our .addin namespace.

// Revit API
using Autodesk.Revit.Attributes;
using Autodesk.Revit.UI;

// geeWiz - internal project objects
using geeWiz.Extensions;
using geeWiz = geeWiz.Forms;
using geeWiz = geeWiz.Utilities.Workshare_Utils;

// The class belongs to the Commands namespace
namespace geeWiz.Cmds_Audit
{
	// Cmd_DeletePatterns
	// Cmd_PurgeRooms
	// Cmd_PurgeTemplates
	// Cmd_PurgeFilters
}

Access modifiers control how this code can be accessed inside and outside your project.
You will typically need to declare at least on of public/private,

And sometimes static for the purposes we will use them for early on.



Static Modifier

The static access modifier is a difficult concept to grasp at first, so we will simplify it somewhat.

Classes with a static modifier do not support the creation of objects of that class (instantiated).
We commonly take advantage of this to create classes which behave more like toolkits, where the class itself acts more like a singe object we can call upon to do things for us.

Classes with a static modifier do not support the creation of objects of that class (instantiated). We commonly take advantage of this to create classes which behave more like toolkits, where the class itself acts more like a singe object we can call upon to do things for us. So basically, the Static modifier is one instrument that you could use to build a complex script with.\nPublic and Private Modifier The public modifier lets you access something anywhere in your project. The private modifier limits access to the same class instead (generally for behind-the-scenes code in the class itself). There are other modifiers, but let’s keep it simple.\nClass Declaration modifiers class ClassName : Interface(s)\nAfter our modifiers we must define our class by using the keyword ‘class’, followed by a Class Name.\nGenerally, most people use PascalCase for class names, and you should choose names which are not reserved elsewhere.\nInterface(s) (Optional) modifiers class ClassName : Interface(s)\nInterface - acts as a template that a class should follow. It’s like a contract that is formed with your class -\u003e the class must have certain methods / properties / behaviours that this interface would provide to it.\nFormally:\nInterfaces are optional agreements that the class must form with predefined class templates. They usually provide methods and properties which would otherwise be cumbersome to access/define, as well as ensuring the class follows some requirements. Referencing a Class Static example (access without creating an instance): var myInstance = ClassName; A static class or member belongs to the class itself, not to any specific object. You use the class name to access it directly. You can call its methods or properties right away — no need to create an object. Because it’s static, you cannot use new to make an instance of it. Example:\n// Accessing a static property without creating Math object Console.WriteLine(Math.PI); Non-static example – Create and use an object var myInstance = new ClassName(); A non-static class needs to be instantiated (created) before you can use it. You create a new object using the new keyword and parentheses () to run its constructor. The variable myInstance now refers to this new object, and you can use its methods and properties. The var keyword tells the compiler to figure out the variable’s type automatically. Example:\nvar car = new Car(); car.Drive(); // Calling an instance method Homework Let’s do the following:\nSet up a class file (.cs) in our project, Create a namespace for it, Define our class (non-static, public). Its purpose is to store and process results from forms we create.\nSolution // 1. Create a new folder (if you haven't already) and call it 'Forms' // 2. Add a new item to 'Forms' -\u003e pick the 'Class' type -\u003e name it: \"Custom.cs\" using System; using System.Collection.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace guRoo.Forms // try to make your namespace follow your folder structure { public static class Custom // change to 'public' + 'static' class { } public class FormResult // add another 'non-static' class { } } Here’s a cleaner, beginner-friendly rewrite with improved structure, simpler explanations, and a working example that will actually compile.\nI’ve also made the terminology more precise and added a clear generic vs. specific constructor example.\n3. Constructors Optional but very useful\nA constructor is a special method that runs automatically when you create a new object from a class:\nIt tells the class how it should start — for example, setting initial values. If you don’t add a constructor, C# uses a default constructor that simply sets properties to their default values, or formally: C# provides an implicit parameterless constructor that sets members to their type defaults. You can make your own constructor to set specific values when an object is created. A class can have multiple constructors (called constructor overloading), which is a form of polymorphism. Constructor Syntax class ClassName { // Constructor with parameters public ClassName(type parameterName) { // Initialization logic } } Example: Generic vs. Specific Constructor Let’s create a FormResult class with two constructors:\nGeneric constructor – takes no arguments (creates a form with default values) Specific constructor – allows setting a custom status when creating the form namespace guRoo.Forms // Use namespaces that match your folder structure { public class FormResult { public string Status { get; set; } // 1. Generic constructor (no parameters) public FormResult() { Status = \"Pending\"; // Default value } // 2. Specific constructor (with parameter) public FormResult(string status) { Status = status; } } } Using the Constructors // Using the generic constructor var form1 = new FormResult(); Console.WriteLine(form1.Status); // Output: Pending // Using the specific constructor var form2 = new FormResult(\"Cancelled\"); Console.WriteLine(form2.Status); // Output: Cancelled Homework In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create two different constructors in a class — one that uses a default value and one that accepts a custom value when creating an object.\nWe’ll do this in a Revit API context by making a simple SheetResult class that stores the name of a sheet.\nYour task:\nCreate a new class called SheetResult in Custom.cs. Add: A generic constructor (no parameters) that sets the SheetName property to “Untitled Sheet”. A specific constructor (with a parameter) that accepts a string and sets SheetName to the provided value. Note: if you add the specific constructor, also add the parameterless one yourself. In Custom.cs, create a static method ShowSheetResultDemo() that: Creates one SheetResult using the generic constructor. Creates another SheetResult using the specific constructor with a custom name. Displays both names in a TaskDialog. In your StartupCommand.Execute() method, call Custom.ShowSheetResultDemo() to run the demo inside Revit. 💡 This will help you understand how constructors work in C#, and how you can use them to set up different ways of creating an object in your Revit add-ins.\nSolution (Copy Paste -\u003e Compile \u0026 Test it in Revit) Custom.cs using Autodesk.Revit.UI; namespace guRoo.Forms { public static class Custom // helper you can call from anywhere { public static void ShowSheetResultDemo() { var sheet1 = new SheetResult(); // generic var sheet2 = new SheetResult(\"A101 - Floor Plan\"); // specific TaskDialog.Show(\"Sheet Results\", $\"Generic constructor: {sheet1.SheetName}\\n\" + $\"Specific constructor: {sheet2.SheetName}\"); } } public class SheetResult { public string SheetName { get; set; } // Parameterless (generic) constructor public SheetResult() =\u003e SheetName = \"Untitled Sheet\"; // Constructor with parameters (specific) public SheetResult(string sheetName) =\u003e SheetName = sheetName; } } StartupCommand.cs using guRoo.Forms; // add this public override void Execute() { // ...your existing code... Custom.ShowSheetResultDemo(); // \u003c-- shows the dialog from Custom.cs } 4. Properties Properties define the data that a class can store and expose.\nWhile you can make properties publicly accessible, best practice is to keep the underlying data private (inside the class) and control access through public get and set accessors.\nThis approach:\nKeeps the internal state of your object safe from unintended changes. Lets you add validation or extra logic when reading or writing values. In simple examples, we’ll mostly use auto-implemented properties (public string Name { get; set; }), but we’ll also show how to back them with private fields when you need more control.\nDeclaring a property A property is like a named piece of data that belongs to a class. The simplest form is an auto-implemented property, which C# creates for you without needing to write extra code:\nClass declaration { modifiers type PropertyName{get;set} } public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } // auto property } Using a private field Sometimes you want more control over how a property’s value is stored or changed. In that case, you can store the value in a private field and use a property to get and set it.\nclass ClassName { private type fieldName; // lowerCamelCase for fields public type PropertyName // PascalCase for properties { get { return fieldName; } set { fieldName = value; } } } Example: public class Person { private string name; // field public string Name // property { get { return name; } set { name = value; } } } 💡 Tip: By convention, fields use camelCase and properties use PascalCase. This makes it easier to spot them in your code.\nHomework Properties let us store and access data in a class. In our earlier example, the SheetResult class only had a SheetName property.\nYour task:\nLet’s expand it to include more information — for example, the SheetNumber And show both a simple auto-property and a property backed by a private field. Solution Custom.cs using Autodesk.Revit.UI; namespace guRoo.Forms { // ===== STATIC CLASS ===== public static class Custom { // ===== METHOD ===== public static void ShowSheetResultDemo() { // Create objects var sheet1 = new SheetResult(); // generic constructor var sheet2 = new SheetResult(\"A101 - Floor Plan\", \"S-001\"); // specific constructor // Show results in Revit dialog TaskDialog.Show(\"Sheet Results\", $\"Generic constructor: {sheet1.SheetName}, Number: {sheet1.SheetNumber}\\n\" + $\"Specific constructor: {sheet2.SheetName}, Number: {sheet2.SheetNumber}\"); } // ===== END METHOD ===== } // ===== END STATIC CLASS ===== // ===== CLASS ===== public class SheetResult { // ===== PROPERTIES ===== // Auto-implemented property public string SheetName { get; set; } // Private field + property with get/set logic private string sheetNumber; public string SheetNumber { get { return sheetNumber; } set { // Example: basic validation if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value)) sheetNumber = \"No Number\"; else sheetNumber = value; } } // ===== END PROPERTIES ===== // ===== CONSTRUCTORS ===== // Generic constructor public SheetResult() { SheetName = \"Untitled Sheet\"; SheetNumber = \"No Number\"; } // Specific constructor public SheetResult(string sheetName, string sheetNumber = \"No Number\") { SheetName = sheetName; SheetNumber = sheetNumber; } // ===== END CONSTRUCTORS ===== } // ===== END CLASS ===== } What Changed? Auto property: SheetName — quick and simple, no custom logic. Property with private field: SheetNumber — lets us add validation before saving the value. Constructors updated so both values can be set when creating a SheetResult. Result in Revit When you run StartupCommand, you’ll still get your original workflow, but now the Custom.ShowSheetResultDemo() dialog will display both the sheet name and the sheet number, with “No Number” automatically set if no value is given.\n5. Methods A method is an action your class can perform.\nThink of it this way:\nProperties = what the object is (its data). Methods = what the object does (its behavior). Key points:\nMethods can take arguments (optional). Methods have a return type. If they return nothing, use void. Declaring a method class ClassName { modifiers returnType MethodName(optionalArguments) { // Code logic here return objectOfType; // omit if return type is void } } Example (continuing our SheetResult) We’ll extend SheetResult with a method that formats its data for display. This reinforces: field + property + constructor + method working together. using Autodesk.Revit.UI; namespace guRoo.Forms { // ------- CALLER (static helper you can invoke from your command) ------- public static class Custom { public static void ShowSheetResultDemo() { var s1 = new SheetResult(); // generic ctor var s2 = new SheetResult(\"A101 - Floor Plan\", \"S-001\"); // specific ctor // Call a METHOD that uses the properties/field TaskDialog.Show(\"Methods Demo\", $\"s1 label: {s1.FormatLabel()}\\n\" + $\"s2 label: {s2.FormatLabel()}\"); } } // ------- DATA MODEL (class with properties, field, constructors, methods) ------- public class SheetResult { // Properties public string SheetName { get; set; } // auto-property // Private field + property with simple validation private string _sheetNumber; // field (camelCase with leading underscore is common) public string SheetNumber { get =\u003e _sheetNumber; set =\u003e _sheetNumber = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value) ? \"No Number\" : value; } // Constructors public SheetResult() { SheetName = \"Untitled Sheet\"; SheetNumber = \"No Number\"; } public SheetResult(string sheetName, string sheetNumber = \"No Number\") { SheetName = sheetName; SheetNumber = sheetNumber; } // METHODS // Returns a formatted label combining the properties public string FormatLabel() { return $\"{SheetNumber} - {SheetName}\"; } // Example of a void method that changes state (optional) public void Rename(string newName) { SheetName = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(newName) ? SheetName : newName; } } } Homework Create a class Add some properties Give it a constructor Demonstrate how to use a field Demonstrate how to make a method Reference our class in another part of your code base Solution Custom.cs using System.Collections.Generic; using Autodesk.Revit.DB; using Autodesk.Revit.UI; namespace guRoo.Forms { public class FormResult { // ====== Field + wrapped property (best practice) ====== private bool _cancelled; public bool ExampleCancelled { get =\u003e _cancelled; set =\u003e _cancelled = value; } // ====== Properties ====== public object Payload { get; set; } public List\u003cobject\u003e Items { get; set; } public bool Cancelled { get; set; } public bool Valid { get; set; } public bool Affirmative { get; set; } // ====== Constructors ====== public FormResult() { Payload = null; Items = new List\u003cobject\u003e(); _cancelled = true; Cancelled = true; Valid = false; Affirmative = false; } public FormResult(bool isValid) { Payload = null; Items = new List\u003cobject\u003e(); _cancelled = !isValid; Cancelled = !isValid; Valid = isValid; Affirmative = isValid; } // ====== Methods ====== // Change state to invalid public void SetToInvalid() { _cancelled = true; Cancelled = true; Valid = false; Affirmative = false; } // Summary for debugging or UI public string Summary() =\u003e $\"Valid: {Valid}, Cancelled: {Cancelled}, Affirmative: {Affirmative}, Items: {Items.Count}\"; // Real-world method: tries to create a sheet based on form state public string TryCreateSheet(Document doc) { if (!Valid || Cancelled) return \"Form is invalid or cancelled. No sheet created.\"; // Grab first available title block ElementId titleBlockId = new FilteredElementCollector(doc) .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_TitleBlocks) .WhereElementIsElementType() .FirstElementId(); if (titleBlockId == ElementId.InvalidElementId) return \"No title block types found. Cannot create sheet.\"; using (Transaction tx = new Transaction(doc, \"Create Sheet\")) { tx.Start(); ViewSheet.Create(doc, titleBlockId); tx.Commit(); } return \"Sheet created successfully!\"; } } } StartCommand.cs using Autodesk.Revit.Attributes; using Autodesk.Revit.DB; using Autodesk.Revit.UI; using Nice3point.Revit.Toolkit.External; using gFrm = guRoo.Forms; namespace guRoo.Commands { [UsedImplicitly] [Transaction(TransactionMode.Manual)] public class StartupCommand : ExternalCommand { public override void Execute() { // Example 1: Default constructor (invalid form) // var formResult = new gFrm.FormResult(); // Example 2: Affirmative constructor (valid form) var formResult = new gFrm.FormResult(true); // Attach the Revit Document to our form object formResult.Payload = Document; // Optionally, flip it to invalid to test // formResult.SetToInvalid(); // Try to create the sheet string operationResult = formResult.TryCreateSheet(Document); // Show result to the user TaskDialog.Show(\"Form + Sheet Creation\", formResult.Summary() + \"\\n\\n\" + operationResult); } } } Disposal Later on, we will look into other things we can make use of, such as specifying what happens to our class instances when they are disposed. Generally, an object will be disposed when it us not needed anymore. The compiler tracks and determines when this occurs for us, but we can also manually dispose of or with the disposal of objects. From there, we’ve learnt all about classes!\nWe now have a basic understanding of:\nClasses in C# Access modifiers Initialization Properties and methods Namespaces 6. Introduction to Interfaces An interface is like a contract for a class.\nIt doesn’t contain actual working code — instead, it defines what properties and methods a class must have.\nIf a class implements an interface, it promises to include all the members that interface defines.\nThis is useful for making sure different classes follow the same pattern, even if they work in different ways inside.\n💡 Think of it as a checklist: the interface says “you must have these items,” and your class fills in the details.\nInterface Example If we have an interface IAnimal that says:\n“You must have a property Legs” “You must have a property Name” “You must have a method MakeNoise()” Then any class implementing IAnimal must include all of those members. // Pseudo Code IAnimal int Legs; string Name; void MakeNoise(); Once a class implements an interface:\nYou write the actual code for the methods in that class. You can set the starting values for the interface’s properties. You can define the behavior of each method however you want. This is why interfaces are considered abstract — they don’t tell you how to do something, only that you must have it.\nThey’re a way to guide multiple classes to share the same “template” of members while letting each class have its own unique implementation.\nUsing an Interface Example // Class that implements the IAnimal interface public class Dog : IAnimal { public int Legs { get; set; } = 4; public string Name { get; set; } = \"Dog\"; public void MakeNoise() { Console.WriteLine(\"Woof!\"); } } Explanation:\nThe Dog class implements IAnimal. The Legs and Name properties are given real values. The MakeNoise() method is given actual behavior (printing “Woof!”). You can implement more than one interface in a single class. By convention, interface names start with I (e.g., IAnimal, IExternalCommand). Argument Provision Many interfaces in the Revit API come with extra built-in support.\nFor example:\nSome interfaces include methods that are automatically called when certain events happen (e.g., a command starts, the application opens, or a document changes). When you implement such an interface, you don’t have to set up the event wiring yourself — Revit will call the method for you. Your job is simply to write the code that runs when the event occurs. 💡 Think of it like Revit saying: “When this happens, I’ll call your method. Just tell me what you want to do inside it.”\nApplication Variants Type Description UIControlledApplication Provides access to the Revit application, typically used on startup and shutdown when no document is yet available. ControlledApplication Represents the application service, giving access to documents, options, and application-specific settings (e.g., language). UIApplication Similar to UIControlledApplication, but available during a running session. We’ll use this often, and in a future lesson we’ll register it as a globally accessible variable. UIDocument Represents the current document at the UI level, giving access to things like selections and opened views. Document Represents the current document at the core API level, providing access to Revit API classes, methods, and properties (e.g., collecting elements). How we can access them? These objects are related in a cascading hierarchy — you can get one from another:\nUIControlledApplication uiCtlApp; // Available at startup/shutdown ControlledApplication ctlApp = uiCtlApp.ControlledApplication; UIApplication uiApp; // Available in commands/events UIDocument uiDoc = uiApp.ActiveUIDocument; Document doc = uiDoc.Document; // The main Revit document API 💡 Tip: At startup/shutdown you’ll usually have UIControlledApplication.\n💡 Tip: During a command / event, you’ll start with UIApplication.\nHomework Implement IExternalApplication Implement IExternalCommand Collect the ControlledApplication in your application entry point Collect the Document inside your command Solution Step 1 — Learn the interface requirements Go to revitapidocs.com.\nYou’ll see that IExternalApplication defines two methods you must implement:\nOnStartup(UIControlledApplication application) — runs when Revit starts. OnShutdown(UIControlledApplication application) — runs when Revit shuts down. Both methods must return a Result enum:\nResult.Succeeded — startup/shutdown completed successfully. Result.Cancelled — you want to cancel the process. Result.Failed — something went wrong. Step 2 — Understand the parameters When OnStartup() or OnShutdown() runs, Revit passes you a UIControlledApplication object.\nFrom this you can get:\nControlledApplication → uiCtlApp.ControlledApplication Gives access to application-level settings, documents list, Revit version info, language, etc. Ribbon and UI setup methods (you can add panels and buttons here). Step 3 — Implementation in Application.cs // Autodesk using Autodesk.Revit.UI // This application belongs to the root namespace namespace guRoo { // Implementing the interface for applications public class Application: IExternalApplication { //This will run on Startup public Result OnStartup(UIControlledApplication uiCtlApp) { // Not sure what this does, explain: car ctlApp = uiCtlApp.ControlledApplication; Not sure, explain better: // This is supposed to be the end of the construction of our toolbar // Meaning it has to result in Success when Revit Launches. return Result.Succeeded; // or Cancelled } // This will urn on shutdown public Result OnShutdown(UIControlledApplication uiCtlApp) { return Result.Succeeded; } } } We now have a basic understanding of:\nInterfaces IExternalApplication IExternalCommand Application Classes Document Classes 7. Create a PushButton Let’s set up a button we can run our command from (we had this before, but we’re doing it the typical way vs the Nice3point way). We will create a tab, a panel, a button and finally set up a basic command that runs when we press it. Understanding Names RibbonTab RibbonPanel Ribbon PushButton What do we need to do? Create our add-in Tab Add a RibbonPanel to the Tab Add a PushButton to the Ribbon Panel Related API Classes: UIControlledApplication \u003e Tab Tab \u003e RibbonPannel RibbonPanel \u003e PushButtonData \u003e PushButton Properties of a PushButton Property Description AssemblyName Assembly path of the button. AvailabilityClassName The full class name of the class providing the entry point to decide availability of this push button. ClassName The name of the class containing the implementation for the command. Enabled Gets or sets a value indicating whether the item is enabled. Image The image of the button. IsEnabledByContext Indicates if this button can be executed. True if permitted based on the current Revit context (active doc, active view, active tool). False if disabled because of the active context. ItemText Gets or sets the text displayed on the item. ItemType Gets the item type. LargeImage The large image shown on the button. LongDescription Long description of the command tooltip. Name The name of the item. ToolTip The description that appears as a tooltip for the item. ToolTipImage The image to show as part of the button’s extended tooltip. Visible Gets or sets a value indicating whether the item is visible. One Important Method -\u003e GetRibbonPanels GetRibbonPannels - Get all the custom Panels on Add-Ins Tab of Revit. GetRibbonPannels(String) - Get all the custom Panels on a designated Revit Tab. GetRibbonPannel(Tab) - Get all the custom Panels on a designated standard Revit Tab. Executing Assembly When our add-in is running, all the classes, resources and code we have produced are executed as an Assembly. We will access this to connect commands to buttons. using System.Reflection Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly() Homework Create a static utility class Add methods to static utility class that we need Run these methods in OnStartup method Create and assign icons and tooltips, Develop a naming system to simplify it all. 8. Global Variables Some programming languages support ‘global’ variables, which can be accessed anywhere at any time once set in the project.\nTo my knowledge, C# does not have a dedicated system for this. We can still achieve this by utilizing a static class that is dedicated to storing and providing these, however.\nLet’s set up a Globals Class, which will give us access to objects that would otherwise be inaccessible from various areas of our project. We will also look at how we can use an event to capture the UIApplication. Why can’t we get the UiApp? We will collect most variables on startup, but the UiApplication is not available during this time in Revit. In order to collect it we will take advantage of the OnIdling Event.\nEvents 101 Events provide us the ability to have code that executes when various events occur in an application. For example, run a code whenever the view is changed. When Revit is available, it is said to be Idling (not doing anything). The OnIdling event is commonly used to run some code as soon as Revit is available for code to be run. Basic Sub/Unsub syntax Subscribe to Idling event UICtlApp.Idling += MethodName\nUnsubsribe from idling event UICtlApp.Idling -= MethodName\nIn most cases, you will want your method to unsubscribe itself once it has run.\nHomework Create a static Globals Class Add properties and registration Register the UiApp using IdlingEvent These tutorials were inspired by the work of Aussie BIM Guru.
