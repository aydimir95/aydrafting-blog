2. What is a Class?

In C#, classes are templates related to the creation and management of objects. There are many predefined classes available in C# and the Revit API.
We use them for a wide range of things and will regularly be creating and developing our own classes.


Accessing properties / methods of a Class

Property:

object.Property


Method:

Object.Method(argument1, argument2, etc)



Namespaces

When we create classes, we first tell them where they belong in our project.
Namespaces can be nested within others using a dot separator, eventually tied back to our .addin namespace.

// Revit API
using Autodesk.Revit.Attributes;
using Autodesk.Revit.UI;

// geeWiz
using geeWiz.Extensions;
using geeWiz = geeWiz.Forms;
using geeWiz = geeWiz.Utilities.Workshare_Utils;

// The class belongs to the Commands namespace
namespace geeWiz.Cmds_Audit
{
	// Cmd_DeletePatterns
	// Cmd_PurgeRooms
	// Cmd_PurgeTemplates
	// Cmd_PurgeFilters
}

Access modifiers control how this code can be accessed inside and outside your project.
You will typically need to declare at least on of public/private,

And sometimes static for the purposes we will use them for early on.



Static Modifier

The static access modifier is a difficult concept to grasp at first, so we will simplify it somewhat.
Classes with a static modifier do not support the creation of objects of that class (instantiated).
We commonly take advantage of this to create classes which behave more like toolkits, where the class itself acts more like a singe object we can call upon to do things for us.

So basically, the `STATIC` modifier is one instrument that you could use to build a complex script with.
Public and Private Modifier

The public modifier lets you access something anywhere in your project.
The private modifier limits access to the same class instead (generally for behind-the-scenes code in the class itself).

There are other modifiers, but let&rsquo;s keep it simple."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/posts/post-7/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.aydrafting.com/posts/post-7/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.aydrafting.com/posts/post-7/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="C# + Revit API: Lesson 7 - Introduction to Classes"><meta property="og:description" content="1.

Classes with a static modifier do not support the creation of objects of that class (instantiated). We commonly take advantage of this to create classes which behave more like toolkits, where the class itself acts more like a singe object we can call upon to do things for us. So basically, the `STATIC` modifier is one instrument that you could use to build a complex script with. Public and Private Modifier The public modifier lets you access something anywhere in your project. The private modifier limits access to the same class instead (generally for behind-the-scenes code in the class itself). There are other modifiers, but let’s keep it simple.\nClass Declaration modifiers class ClassName : Interface(s)\nAfter our modifiers we must define our class by using the keyword ‘class’, followed by a Class Name.\nGenerally, most people use PascalCase for class names, and you should choose names which are not reserved elsewhere.\nInterface(s) (optional) modifiers class ClassName : Interface(s)\nInterfaces are optional agreements that the class must form with predefined class templates. We will cover these in our next lesson at a basic level. They usually provide methods and properties which would otherwise be cumbersome to access/define, as well as ensuring the class follows some requirements. Referencing a Class Static example (access): var myInstance = ClassName; Non-static example (instantiate) var myInstance = new ClassName(); Homework Let’s do the following:\nSet up a class file (.cs) in our project Create a namespace for it Define our class (non-static, public) We will use this class later in our toolbar. Its purpose is to store and process results from forms we create.\n3. Constructors By default, your class assumes it is constructed with default options specified for properties it supports. If we want to make our constructor more specific, we need to add constructors to the class first. We can support more than one constructor, which is typically referred to as polymorphism. Constructor Syntax Class declaration { modifiers ClassName(arguments) { Code logic here; } } Homework Add a generic constructor Add a specific constructor We will provide the option for a user to specify the pre-cancelled status of a form, as well as declare one without any arguments.\n4. Properties We can define custom properties the class is able to support. Whilst you can make the properties available outside the class, best practice is to keep them private to the class, then using the property simple but get/set that value instead. Generally, we will be keeping things simple but will show how you can use private properties as well (fields), given it is better practice. Declaring a property Class declaration { modifiers type PropertyName{get;set} } Using a private field Class declaration { private type fieldName // Camel Case for properties public type PropertyName { get {return fieldname} // lower case for the fields set {fieldname=value} } } 5. Methods Unlike the properties, methods generally do something to or with a class object. They are called similarly to a property but support the inclusion of arguments. Whilst for a property we declare its type, for a method we declare its return type (the type of data the method returns at the end). If we want to return nothing, we can use the type void.\nDeclaring a method Class declaration { modifiers returnType MethodName(kwarg) // kwarg - arguments are optional { Code logic; return objectOfType; } } Homework Add some properties Demonstrate how to use a field Demonstrate how to make a method Call on our class in some code Disposal Later on, we will look into other things we can make use of, such as specifying what happens to our class instances when they are disposed. Generally, an object will be disposed when it us not needed anymore. The compiler tracks and determines when this occurs for us, but we can also manually dispose of or with the disposal of objects. From there, we’ve learnt all about classes!\nWe now have a basic understanding of:\nClasses in C# Access modifiers Initialization Properties and methods Namespaces 6. Interfaces Interfaces provide abstract templates (sometimes called contracts) by which classes must more specifically implement them. By the end of this lesson we will have implemented two in our add-in. Interface Example This interface entails that any class implementing it must have 2 properties and methods. They are abstractly provided and are specifically built in the class itself. // Pseudo Code IAnimal int Legs; string Name; void MakeNoise(); // Real Implementation class Dog: IAnimal int Legs = 4; string Name = \"Dog\"; void MakeNoise() { Dog.Woof(); } We provide the interface to the Dog class, which will in turn expect the properties and method to be specified further. You can add more than 1 interface to a class and we usually name interfaces with a prefix of ‘I’. Argument provision Many Interfaces provided by the Revit API have further code support included for us. For example, Interfaces commonly provide methods which are triggered by events. We do not have to set up the sender/receiver methods if we implement the interface, only specify what happens when the event occurs. Application Variants When we implement our two interfaces, we will be using some special types. UIControlledApplication Provides access to the Revit application, is commonly on startup and shutdown, where a document is not yet available. ControlledApplication Represents the application service, giving us access to documents, options, and application specific settings (e.g. language). UIApplication Similar to UIControlledApplication, but it is available during our session. We will be using this a lot and in a future lesson we will register it to a globally accessible variable. UIDocument Represents the current document at a UI level, providing access to aspects such as selection and opened views. Document Represents the current document, providing access to many Revit API classes, methods, and properties at the document level, e.g. collecting elements in the document. How we can access them? uiCtlApp // Available at start-up/shutdown ctlApp // uiCtlApp.ControlledApplication uiApp // Idling event / via commands uiDoc // uiApp.ActiveUIDocument doc // uiDoc.Document Homework Implement IExternalApplication Implement IExternalCommand Collect the ControlledApplication Collect the Document in a command We now have a basic understanding of: Interfaces IExternalApplication IExternalCommand Application Classes Document Classes 7. Create a PushButton Let’s set up a button we can run our command from (we had this before, but we’re doing it the typical way vs the Nice3Point way). We will create a tab, a panel, a button and finally set up a basic command that runs when we press it. Understanding Names RibbonTab RibbonPanel Ribbon PushButton What do we need to do? Create our add-in Tab Add a RibbonPanel to the Tab Add a PushButton to the Ribbon Panel Related API Classes: UIControlledApplication \u003e Tab Tab \u003e RibbonPannel RibbonPanel \u003e PushButtonData \u003e PushButton Properties of a PushButton AssemblyName - Assembly Path of the Button AvailabilityClassName - The full class name of the class providing the entry point to decide availability of this push button. ClassName - The name of the class containing the implementation for the command. Enabled - Gets or sets a value indicating whether the item is enabled. Image - The image of the button. IsEnabledByContext - Indicates if this button can be executed. True is the pushbutton is permitted to be executed based on the current Revit context (active doc, active view, active tool). False if the pushbutton is disabled because of the active context. ItemText - Gets or sets the text displayed of the item. ItemType - Get the item type. LargeImage - The large image shown on the button. LongDescription - Long description of the command tooltip. Name - The name of the item. ToolTip - The description that appears as a ToolTip for the item. ToolTipImage - The image to show as a part of the button extended tooltip. Visible - Gets or sets a value indicating whether the item is visible. One Important Method -\u003e GetRibbonPanels GetRibbonPannels - Get all the custom Panels on Add-Ins Tab of Revit. GetRibbonPannels(String) - Get all the custom Panels on a designated Revit Tab. GetRibbonPannel(Tab) - Get all the custom Panels on a designated standard Revit Tab. Executing Assembly When our add-in is running, all the classes, resources and code we have produced are executed as an Assembly. We will access this to connect commands to buttons. using System.Reflection Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly() Homework Create a static utility class Add methods to static utility class that we need Run these methods in OnStartup method In the next video, we will add to this:\nCreate and assign icons and tooltips, Develop a naming system to simplify it all. 8. Global Variables Some programming languages support ‘global’ variables, which can be accessed anywhere at any time once set in the project.\nTo my knowledge, C# does not have a dedicated system for this. We can still achieve this by utilizing a static class that is dedicated to storing and providing these, however.\nLet’s set up a Globals Class, which will give us access to objects that would otherwise be inaccessible from various areas of our project. We will also look at how we can use an event to capture the UIApplication. Why can’t we get the UiApp? We will collect most variables on startup, but the UiApplication is not available during this time in Revit. In order to collect it we will take advantage of the OnIdling Event.\nEvents 101 Events provide us the ability to have code that executes when various events occur in an application. For example, run a code whenever the view is changed. When Revit is available, it is said to be Idling (not doing anything). The OnIdling event is commonly used to run some code as soon as Revit is available for code to be run. Basic Sub/Unsub syntax Subscribe to Idling event UICtlApp.Idling += MethodName\nUnsubsribe from idling event UICtlApp.Idling -= MethodName\nIn most cases, you will want your method to unsubscribe itself once it has run.\nHomework Create a static Globals Class Add properties and registration Register the UiApp using IdlingEvent These tutorials were inspired by the work of Aussie BIM Guru.
