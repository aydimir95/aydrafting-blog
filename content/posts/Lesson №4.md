# Logical Operators

`x == y` => *true  if x is equal to y*

`x != y` => *true if x is not equal to y*

`x > y` => *true if x is greater than y*

`x < y` => *true if x is less than y*

`x >= y` => *true if x greater than or equals to y*

`x <= y` => *true if x less than or equals to y*

---

`x || y` => *true if x OR y are true*

`x && y `=> *true if x AND y are true*

`!(x)` => *true if not x (can also use 'not' x)*

`x ^ y` => *true if x OR y are true, but not both*

## `Null` Operations / Operands


`x?.Method()` => *If x is null, Method() will NOT run*

`x ??= value` => *If x is null, set it to value specified*

`x is null` => *True if x is Null, False if it's not Null*

`if (x)` => *if x is Null, it yields Null or false*
